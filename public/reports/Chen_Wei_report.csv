"""Comprehensive Examination Behavior Report for Candidate ID: c3, Exam ID: exam-102. Overall Suspicion Assessment: The candidate registered a suspicion score of 12, indicating a relatively low to moderate level of detected suspicious activity during the examination session. Behavioral Statistics Analysis: Gaze Deviation Percentage: A significant gaze deviation of 63.23% was observed. This high percentage suggests that the candidate's gaze was directed away from the primary exam interface or monitoring area for a substantial portion of the exam duration, which is a key indicator for potential external distraction or unauthorized material use. Talk Time: The candidate accumulated 51.61 seconds of talk time. While some self-talk is permissible, this duration warrants consideration, as unauthorized verbal communication during an exam is a concern. Head Movement Frequency: A head movement frequency of 0.98 was recorded. This suggests frequent head movements, which might indicate discomfort, distraction, or attempts to view areas outside the direct line of sight of the camera. Summary of Suspicious Activities: The most prominent suspicious behavior is the high gaze deviation, which indicates a significant lack of focus on the exam screen. The recorded talk time and frequent head movements, while individually less severe, contribute to a pattern of behavior that deviates from standard proctored exam conduct. Overall Assessment and Recommendation: Candidate c3 displayed several behavioral anomalies, with the high gaze deviation percentage being the most notable concern. Despite an overall suspicion score that might be considered low-to-moderate, the specific behavioral metrics suggest potential non-compliance or external factors influencing the candidate's focus. It is recommended that this examination session undergo a manual review of video and audio logs to thoroughly investigate the nature and implications of these observed behaviors."""
